# Known Outages in Commodities Trading Ecosystem

In **commodities trading**, outages can come from **internal CTRM/ETRM systems** *or* from **external dependencies** (exchanges, clearing houses, banks, data providers). Because outages can freeze trading or risk management, they are **high-impact events**.


## Exchange Outages

Exchanges are central — if they fail, both trading and risk management grind to a halt.

* **ICE (Intercontinental Exchange)**: has had historical outages where futures trading halted (energy contracts impacted).
* **CME Group**: in Feb 2020, CME suffered an outage affecting Globex platform, halting futures/options trading across crude oil, grains, metals.
* **LME (London Metal Exchange)**: in 2022, the LME suspended nickel trading for days after extreme price swings, effectively an "outage by design."

**Impact**: No trades can be captured or hedged, risk models can’t update positions.



## Market Data Provider Outages

Real-time pricing is critical for risk and P&L.

* **Bloomberg**: has experienced global outages (2015: a major Bloomberg terminal outage disrupted trading worldwide for hours).
* **Refinitiv (Thomson Reuters Eikon)**: occasional downtime, affecting price feeds.
* **Platts / Argus**: outages in publishing benchmark prices delayed settlements.

**Impact**: Risk calcs fail, settlement can’t be priced, compliance reporting inaccurate.



## CTRM / ETRM System Outages

Vendor platforms used by trading houses can fail.

* **Openlink Endur / Allegro / Aspect**: some firms reported outages due to patchy upgrades or DB corruption.
* **In-house systems**: failures from scaling (trade booking spikes), DB locks, or messaging middleware failures (e.g., Kafka cluster outage).

**Impact**: Traders can’t book new deals, operations can’t release shipments, compliance can’t generate reports.



## Banking / Settlement Outages

Financial workflows depend on banking infrastructure.

* **SWIFT outages**: rare, but when they occur, settlements can’t move.
* **Bank APIs**: corporate banking outages delay Letters of Credit and payments.
* **Clearing houses**: ICE Clear, CME Clearing disruptions stop margin calls and settlements.

**Impact**: Settlements fail, counterparties lose trust, operational risks spike.



## Infrastructure & Cloud Outages

* **Cloud providers**:

  * AWS outages (notably 2020, 2021) took down trading apps hosted there.
  * Azure and GCP also had regional outages affecting CTRM SaaS platforms.
* **Networking**:

  * Internal datacenter fiber cuts or DNS failures → traders lose access.

**Impact**: Full CTRM downtime, inability to access positions or book trades.



## Regulatory & Compliance Reporting Outages

* **Trade Repositories (TRs)**: ESMA-registered TRs like DTCC, Regis-TR, UnaVista have reported outages → firms can’t report EMIR/MiFID trades.
* **Nominations systems in energy trading**: failures prevented gas/power scheduling in markets like EEX or Nord Pool.

**Impact**: Firms risk non-compliance penalties.



## Common Causes of Outages

* **Volume spikes** (price crash, geopolitical events).
* **Software defects** (patch gone wrong, DB deadlocks).
* **External dependency failures** (market data/exchange).
* **Cyber incidents** (DDoS attacks on exchanges).
* **Operational mistakes** (misconfigured upgrade, wrong reference data).



## Summary

Known outages in commodities trading affect:

* **Exchanges** (CME, ICE, LME).
* **Market data providers** (Bloomberg, Refinitiv, Platts).
* **CTRM platforms** (vendor or in-house).
* **Banking/settlement** (SWIFT, clearing houses).
* **Cloud/infra** (AWS, Azure).
* **Regulatory systems** (TRs, energy scheduling).

Each outage can **freeze trading, risk, settlement, or compliance** — which is why firms invest heavily in **resilience, DR, and monitoring**.
