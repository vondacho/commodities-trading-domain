# Tackling NFRs in Commodities Trading Systems

Tackling Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) in a system like a Commodities Trading Platform requires a mix of architectural patterns, technology choices, and operational practices. Let’s go through the usual alternatives per NFR category.

## Performance & Scalability

* **Caching**: In-memory caches (Redis, Hazelcast) for market data and trade lookups.
* **Parallelization**: Grid computing for risk (e.g., VaR distributed across cluster).
* **Scalable architecture**: Horizontal scaling with microservices or cloud auto-scaling.
* **CQRS**: Separate read/write models to optimize queries (e.g., positions dashboard).

## Availability & Reliability

* **High Availability setups**: Active-active clustering, load balancers.
* **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region replication, failover orchestration.
* **Chaos engineering**: Proactively test failure modes (Netflix Chaos Monkey style).

## Security

* **Authentication & Authorization**: RBAC, ABAC, OAuth2/OIDC, multi-factor authentication.
* **Encryption**: TLS 1.2+ for transit, AES-256 at rest.
* **Secrets Management**: Vault, KMS for keys and credentials.
* **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify identity and context on every request.

## Data Integrity & Consistency

* **Database Transactions**: ACID transactions for trades and settlements.
* **Event Sourcing**: Immutable log of domain events (`TradeCaptured`, `PaymentSettled`).
* **Idempotency**: Ensure retrying (e.g., trade ingestion from FIX) doesn’t duplicate.
* **Reconciliation Tools**: Automated checks against exchanges, banks, warehouses.

## Interoperability & Integration

* **Messaging**: Kafka, MQ for async integration between services.
* **APIs**: REST/GraphQL for internal modules; FIX/FPML/SWIFT for external.
* **Enterprise Service Bus (legacy)**: Used in SOA contexts for orchestration.
* **Adapters / ACL (Anti-Corruption Layer)**: Translate external models into domain model.

## Usability

* **Role-based dashboards**: Traders (positions, P&L), Risk Managers (limits, VaR), Ops (logistics).
* **UI frameworks**: Rich web UIs (React, Angular), streaming dashboards.
* **Internationalization**: Multi-language, multi-currency, time-zone aware UIs.
* **Alerting/notifications**: Configurable alerts for breaches or anomalies.

## Compliance & Auditability

* **Immutable Audit Logs**: Event sourcing or append-only stores (Kafka log, blockchain-like).
* **Data Retention**: Configurable per regulation (MiFID II = 5+ years).
* **Regulatory APIs**: Interfaces to trade repositories and regulators.
* **Traceability**: End-to-end trace of “who did what when.”

## Maintainability & Extensibility

* **Modular Architecture**: Microservices or plug-in modules.
* **DevOps Practices**: CI/CD pipelines, automated regression testing.
* **Domain-Driven Design**: Bounded contexts, aggregates to keep complexity manageable.
* **Configuration-driven features**: Add new commodity types without redeployment.

## Analytics & Data Management

* **Data Lakes**: Store tick data, logistics, IoT feeds for analytics.
* **Stream Processing**: Flink, Spark Streaming for real-time P&L or exposure.
* **Machine Learning**: Forecast demand, weather, congestion.
* **Time-series Databases**: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB for market curves.

## Cost & Efficiency

* **Cloud elasticity**: Pay-as-you-go scaling (AWS, Azure, GCP).
* **Serverless for batch**: Regulatory reports, ad-hoc analytics.
* **Containerization**: Kubernetes for resource efficiency.
* **FinOps practices**: Continuous monitoring of cost vs. utilization.

## Summary

To meet NFRs, **architectural tactics** are usually:

* **Performance** → caching, parallelization, CQRS.
* **Availability** → redundancy, DR, chaos testing.
* **Security** → zero trust, encryption, RBAC.
* **Consistency** → transactions, event sourcing, reconciliation.
* **Integration** → APIs, messaging, adapters.
* **Compliance** → immutable logs, reporting APIs.
* **Maintainability** → modular design, CI/CD, DDD.
* **Analytics** → data lakes, ML, stream processing.
* **Cost efficiency** → cloud elasticity, containerization.
