# NFRs for Commodities Trading Systems

An IT system in commodities trading must be:

* **Fast** (low latency, real-time risk).
* **Reliable** (always on, globally redundant).
* **Secure & compliant** (regulatory + cybersecurity).
* **Integrable** (with exchanges, banks, ERP, logistics).
* **Flexible** (new commodities, instruments, regulations).

## Performance & Scalability

* Handle **high trade volumes** (thousands to millions daily, depending on asset class).
* Real-time **mark-to-market valuations** across portfolios.
* Low-latency **market data ingestion** (sub-second for intraday traders).
* Scale horizontally as commodity coverage expands (energy, metals, agri).

## Availability & Reliability

* **High availability** (â‰¥99.9%) to avoid trading disruptions.
* **Disaster recovery** with RPO near-zero and RTO < 1 hour.
* **Redundancy** across data centers or cloud regions.
* Support for 24x7 global operations across time zones.

## Security

* Strong **authentication & authorization** (RBAC, MFA).
* **Data encryption** in transit and at rest (trades, counterparties, pricing).
* **Audit trails** for all actions (regulatory requirement).
* Compliance with **cybersecurity standards** (ISO 27001, NIST, SOC2).

## Data Integrity & Consistency

* Accurate, tamper-proof recording of trades and settlements.
* Synchronization between **front, middle, and back office** modules.
* Support for **event sourcing** or transaction logs for recovery.
* Guaranteed **reconciliation** with banks, exchanges, and warehouses.

## Interoperability & Integration

* Integration with **exchanges** (CME, ICE, LME).
* Support for **market data feeds** (Bloomberg, Refinitiv, Platts, Argus).
* Interfaces with **banks** (letters of credit, SWIFT).
* Connectors to **ERP systems** (SAP, Oracle) for finance/accounting.
* Open **APIs** for algorithmic trading and advanced analytics.

## Usability

* Role-based UIs for traders, risk managers, operators, compliance officers.
* Real-time dashboards for **positions, risk, P&L, inventory**.
* Configurable alerts and workflows.
* Multi-language and multi-currency support.

## Compliance & Auditability

* Regulatory reporting: **EMIR, MiFID II, Dodd-Frank, REMIT, MAR**.
* **Full trade audit trails**: who entered, modified, or approved.
* Data retention policies aligned with legal requirements.
* Support for ESG/Sustainability compliance (carbon credits, traceability).

## Maintainability & Extensibility

* Modular architecture to add new commodities or instruments.
* Support for continuous upgrades without downtime.
* Well-documented APIs and configuration.
* Automated regression testing for new releases.

## Analytics & Data Management

* Real-time pricing engines and risk analytics.
* Support for **historical analysis** (backtesting, stress tests).
* Big data handling: satellite imagery, IoT data from storage/logistics.
* AI/ML integration for forecasting.

## Cost & Efficiency

* Optimized **infrastructure costs** (cloud/on-prem hybrid).
* Efficient use of compute for real-time risk vs. batch reporting.
* License flexibility: scale users without exponential cost growth.
