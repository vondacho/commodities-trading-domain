# Testing Strategies

In **commodities trading systems (CTRM/ETRM)**, **testing strategies** are absolutely critical because errors can lead to **huge financial losses, compliance breaches, or operational disruptions**.

Testing needs to cover both **functional** and **non-functional** dimensions, across highly interconnected bounded contexts.

## Unit Testing

**Goal**: Validate **isolated domain logic** (aggregates, value objects, services).

**Examples**:

  * A `Trade` aggregate rejects negative quantities.
  * A `Settlement` cannot be executed if LC expired.

**Tactics**:

  * Mock repositories & external services.
  * Focus on domain invariants from tactical DDD.


## Component / Module Testing

**Goal**: Validate one bounded context in isolation.

**Examples**:

  * `Risk Management` correctly recalculates P&L after receiving trades.
  * `Logistics` correctly updates inventory when shipment is scheduled.

**Tactics**:

  * Use in-memory DB (H2, SQLite) for repositories.
  * Contract testing to validate service boundaries.


## Integration Testing

**Goal**: Validate collaboration between **contexts/services**.

**Examples**:

  * `TradeCaptured` event triggers `Risk` update and `Settlement` creation.
  * `Logistics` updates flow into `Compliance`.

**Tactics**:

  * Event-driven integration tests (Kafka test topics).
  * Use **Testcontainers** for DBs, message brokers.


## End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Goal**: Validate full workflows across the system.
  
**Examples**:

  * Trade lifecycle: Capture → Risk → Logistics → Settlement → Compliance report.
  * Stress scenario: Bulk trades ingestion.

**Tactics**:

  * Use **BDD/Gherkin** scenarios (we already modeled some).
  * Automate with Cucumber/Behave, link to CI/CD pipelines.


## Non-Functional Testing

Critical for CTRM due to regulatory and risk implications:

**Performance Testing**:

  * Can system process 10k trades/min under <200ms latency?
  * Tools: JMeter, Gatling.

**Scalability Testing**:

  * Simulate stress (100k trades in 1 min).
  * Auto-scale microservices.

**Resilience/Chaos Testing**:

  * Kill Risk service → does saga recover?
  * Tools: Chaos Monkey, Gremlin.

**Security Testing**:

  * Penetration tests, static analysis (SAST/DAST).
  * Validate encryption, role-based access.

**Data Consistency Testing**:

  * Reconciliation between trades and settlements.
  * Compare CTRM records with exchange/bank data.


## Regression Testing

**Goal**: Prevent breakage after changes.

**Tactics**:

  * Automated test suites for domain rules.
  * Golden datasets (historical trades, risk calcs) for validation.
  * Snapshot-based testing for event sourcing.


## Contract Testing (Consumer-Driven)

**Goal**: Ensure APIs/events remain compatible across services.

**Examples**:

  * If Risk expects `TradeCaptured` event with `tradeId`, schema cannot change silently.

**Tools**: Pact, Spring Cloud Contract.


## Test Data Management

**Synthetic Data**: Generate realistic trades, prices, shipments.

**Masked Data**: Use anonymized production data for UAT.

**Scenario Libraries**: Store stress events (oil price crash, LC expired).


## Environments & Automation

**CI/CD**: Run unit, integration, regression tests on every commit.

**Test Environments**:

  * Dev → QA → UAT → Prod.

**Automation**:

  * GitHub Actions, Jenkins pipelines.



## Summary

Testing strategy in CTRM combines:

* **Unit** tests for domain rules.
* **Integration/E2E** tests for workflows.
* **Non-functional** tests (performance, resilience, security).
* **Contract & regression** tests for stability.
* **BDD/Gherkin** for business-readable specs.
* **Synthetic + masked data** for realistic scenarios.
