# Use Cases in Commodities Trading systems

An IT system that supports the commodities trading domain must serve both the front office (traders, risk managers) and the back/middle office (operations, finance, compliance), as well as integrate with external ecosystems (exchanges, logistics providers, banks).

A **CTRM — Commodity Trading & Risk Management system** is expected to:

* **Capture trades**,
* **Manage risk**,
* **Track physical flows**,
* **Handle finance/settlement**,
* **Stay compliant**, and
* **Provide analytics** for better decision-making.

## Trade Capture & Deal Lifecycle Management

* Record physical and financial trades (spot, forwards, futures, swaps, options, freight).
* Support for multiple asset classes (energy, metals, agri).
* Handle full trade lifecycle: initiation → confirmation → settlement.
* Interfaces with brokers, exchanges (e.g., CME, ICE, LME), and OTC deals.


## Risk Management

* **Market risk**: Mark-to-market valuations, VaR (Value at Risk), P&L analysis.
* **Credit risk**: Counterparty exposure, limits monitoring, collateral tracking.
* **Operational risk**: Logistics disruptions, contract mismatches.
* Scenario analysis (e.g., oil price shock, FX volatility, weather events).


## Position & Exposure Management

* Track long/short positions across physical and paper trades.
* Monitor hedging effectiveness (linking physical cargo to futures/swaps).
* Real-time dashboards: inventory in transit, storage balances, contractual commitments.


## Logistics & Operations

* Shipment scheduling (tankers, pipelines, trains, warehouses).
* Inventory management (silos, tanks, LME/ICE warehouses).
* Blending & transformation tracking (e.g., crude → refined products).
* Integration with IoT/telemetry for stock monitoring.


## Financing & Settlement

* Integration with banks for **letters of credit, guarantees, collateral management**.
* Payment workflows: invoicing, settlements, reconciliations.
* Trade finance: pre-export financing, repo, credit facilities.
* Multi-currency, multi-jurisdiction accounting support.


## Compliance & Reporting

* Regulatory compliance: EMIR, MiFID II, Dodd-Frank, REMIT, MAR.
* KYC/AML monitoring for counterparties.
* Environmental compliance: carbon credits, sustainability certificates.
* Reporting to regulators, exchanges, and internal audit.


## Analytics & Decision Support

* Pricing engines (using curves, forward curves, spreads).
* Forecasting with AI/ML: weather impacts, yield predictions, shipping congestion.
* Scenario simulation: geopolitical shocks, policy changes, demand shifts.
* Profitability and margin analysis by trade, region, commodity.


## Integration & Ecosystem Connectivity

* **External integrations**: exchanges, clearinghouses, banks, logistics providers.
* **Market data feeds**: Bloomberg, Refinitiv, Platts, Argus.
* **ERP integration**: SAP, Oracle for accounting/finance.
* APIs for algorithmic trading and advanced analytics.
