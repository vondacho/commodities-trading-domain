# Strategic DDD for Commodities Trading domain

From a DDD perspective, commodities trading decomposes into **bounded contexts** around trade, risk, logistics, finance, compliance, and analytics.

* **Entities & Aggregates** manage core business objects (Trade, Shipment, Settlement, Portfolio).
* **Value Objects** model immutable concepts (Price, Quantity, Currency).
* **Domain Events** capture state transitions critical to business processes.
* **Context Maps** define how subdomains collaborate.

## Core Domain & Subdomains

At its heart, commodities trading is about **managing trades and risks** across **physical flows** and **financial instruments**.
We can split the domain into **subdomains**:

* **Trade Capture & Deal Lifecycle** (core)
* **Risk Management** (core)
* **Logistics & Operations** (supporting)
* **Financing & Settlement** (supporting)
* **Compliance & Reporting** (generic/subdomain)
* **Analytics & Decision Support** (supporting/strategic)

## Strategic Design

* **Core Domain**: Trade Capture & Risk Management (where competitive advantage lies).
* **Supporting Domains**: Logistics, Financing, Analytics (specialized but not unique).
* **Generic Domains**: Compliance, Reporting (mandatory but commoditized).

This informs **build vs. buy** decisions — e.g., build risk engine in-house, but buy compliance modules.

## Bounded Contexts

Each subdomain can be modeled as a bounded context with its own **ubiquitous language** and models.

### Trade Capture Context

* Entities: `Trade`, `Counterparty`, `Instrument`, `Contract`
* Value Objects: `Price`, `Quantity`, `TradeDate`, `TradeId`
* Aggregates: `Trade` (root, holds trade lines, instrument, counterparty, status)
* Events: `TradeCaptured`, `TradeAmended`, `TradeCancelled`
* Services: `TradeValidationService`, `TradeBookingService`

### Risk Management Context

* Entities: `Position`, `Exposure`, `RiskLimit`, `Portfolio`
* Value Objects: `MarkToMarket`, `VaR`, `ScenarioResult`
* Aggregates: `Portfolio` (root for positions & exposures)
* Events: `PositionUpdated`, `LimitBreached`, `PnLCalculated`
* Services: `RiskCalculationService`, `MarketDataFeed`

### Logistics Context

* Entities: `Shipment`, `StorageFacility`, `InventoryLot`
* Value Objects: `Quantity`, `Location`, `Incoterms`
* Aggregates: `Shipment` (root; includes lots, schedules, destination)
* Events: `ShipmentScheduled`, `ShipmentDelivered`, `InventoryAdjusted`
* Services: `LogisticsSchedulingService`, `InventoryReconciliationService`

### Financing & Settlement Context

* Entities: `Settlement`, `PaymentInstruction`, `LetterOfCredit`
* Value Objects: `Currency`, `Amount`, `SettlementDate`
* Aggregates: `Settlement` (root; holds trade reference, payment details, status)
* Events: `PaymentSettled`, `LCExpired`, `SettlementFailed`
* Services: `SettlementProcessingService`, `BankIntegrationService`

### Compliance Context

* Entities: `RegulatoryReport`, `AuditLog`, `KYCRecord`
* Value Objects: `LEI`, `UTI`, `Timestamp`
* Aggregates: `Report` (root)
* Events: `ReportGenerated`, `KYCFlagged`
* Services: `RegulatoryReportingService`, `AuditTrailService`

### Analytics Context

* Entities: `Curve`, `Scenario`, `Forecast`
* Value Objects: `ForwardPrice`, `StressFactor`
* Aggregates: `MarketAnalysis`
* Events: `CurveGenerated`, `ScenarioRunCompleted`
* Services: `PricingEngine`, `ForecastingService`

Bounded contexts interact through **integrations and translations**:

* **Trade Capture → Risk Management**: trades feed into positions & exposures.
* **Trade Capture → Logistics**: physical trades trigger shipment creation.
* **Trade Capture → Financing**: financial obligations flow into settlements.
* **Risk Management ↔ Analytics**: pricing, curves, scenarios enrich valuations.
* **Financing → Compliance**: settlements must generate reports and logs.
* **All contexts → Compliance**: audit trail is ubiquitous.

### Trade Capture → Risk Management

* **Pattern**: *Conformist / Customer-Supplier*
* Risk depends on trade data and has to conform to the model exposed by Trade Capture.
* **Implication**: Risk Management consumes trades, but does not redefine them.

### Trade Capture → Logistics

* **Pattern**: *Customer-Supplier*
* Logistics depends on physical trade details (quantities, delivery terms).
* **Implication**: Logistics must align with trade capture’s definitions of quantity, commodity, counterparty.

### Trade Capture → Financing & Settlement

* **Pattern**: *Customer-Supplier*
* Settlement requires trade details to generate obligations.
* **Implication**: Trade Capture is the source of truth; Finance aligns to its schema.

### Risk Management ↔ Analytics

* **Pattern**: *Partnership*
* Risk and Analytics collaborate — risk engines depend on analytics (curves, scenarios), analytics depends on trades and positions.
* **Implication**: Shared model, high collaboration.

### Financing & Settlement → Compliance

* **Pattern**: *Open Host Service*
* Compliance “subscribes” to settlement events and consumes data for regulatory reporting.
* **Implication**: Compliance is generic and should not impose its model upstream.

### Trade Capture → Compliance

* **Pattern**: *Published Language*
* Compliance consumes trade data for audit and regulatory reports.
* **Implication**: A shared vocabulary (UTI, LEI, trade identifiers) ensures consistency.

### Risk Management → Compliance

* **Pattern**: *Published Language*
* Compliance consumes risk metrics (VaR, exposures).
* **Implication**: Needs standardized reporting language.

### Logistics → Compliance

* **Pattern**: *Published Language*
* Compliance consumes shipment and delivery events.
* **Implication**: Compliance translates delivery events into regulatory language (e.g., REMIT).

## Event Storming

Key domain events across contexts:

* `TradeCaptured`, `TradeConfirmed`, `TradeAmended`
* `PositionUpdated`, `LimitBreached`, `PnLCalculated`
* `ShipmentScheduled`, `ShipmentDelivered`
* `PaymentSettled`, `LCExpired`
* `ReportGenerated`, `KYCFlagged`

These events form the backbone of an **event-driven architecture**.
