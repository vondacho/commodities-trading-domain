# Commodities Trading

Commodities trading is the buying and selling of raw materials or primary agricultural products, either physically or through financial instruments.

It’s one of the oldest forms of trade and still underpins much of the global economy.

## Types of Commodities

### Hard commodities
  * Natural resources extracted or mined.
  * Energy: crude oil, natural gas, coal, electricity.
  * Metals: gold, silver, copper, aluminum, platinum, etc.
  
### Soft commodities
  * Agricultural or livestock products.
  * Grains: wheat, corn, soybeans, rice.
  * Livestock: cattle, hogs.
  * Others: coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton, orange juice.


## Trading Venues

* **Spot markets**: Immediate delivery of physical commodities.
* **Futures markets**: Standardized contracts to buy/sell at a future date (e.g., CME, ICE, LME).
* **OTC (Over-the-Counter)**: Customized deals directly between parties (common in energy).


## Key Instruments

* **Futures contracts** – standardized, highly liquid, used for hedging and speculation.
* **Options on futures** – provide the right (not obligation) to buy/sell at a set price.
* **Swaps** – exchange of cash flows, often used in energy (e.g., fixed-for-floating price).
* **ETFs & indices** – allow exposure without direct futures trading.
* **Physical contracts** – shipping, warehousing, and delivery agreements.


## Market Participants

* **Producers & consumers**: Oil companies, miners, farmers, food manufacturers, airlines (hedging against price fluctuations).
* **Traders**: Glencore, Vitol, Trafigura, Cargill (profit from logistics, arbitrage, speculation).
* **Speculators & investors**: Hedge funds, asset managers, retail traders.
* **Governments & regulators**: Influence supply/demand and oversee market fairness.


## Trading Strategies

* **Hedging**: Protect against adverse price movements (e.g., airlines hedge jet fuel).
* **Speculation**: Profit from anticipating price moves (e.g., going long gold before inflation).
* **Arbitrage**: Exploiting price differences across markets, time, or geographies.
* **Spread trading**: Trading price differentials (calendar spreads, crack spreads in oil).


## Factors Driving Prices

* **Supply-side**: Weather, geopolitics, strikes, production cuts, technology.
* **Demand-side**: Economic growth, consumer trends, industrial cycles.
* **Macroeconomics**: Inflation, interest rates, currencies.
* **Logistics**: Shipping costs, bottlenecks, storage availability.
* **Speculative flows**: Large capital movements from funds can amplify volatility.


## Risks

* **Price volatility**: Commodities can swing sharply.
* **Geopolitical risk**: Wars, sanctions, trade disputes.
* **Credit risk**: Counterparty default in OTC trades.
* **Operational/logistics risk**: Transport, storage, quality issues.
* **Regulatory & environmental**: Carbon markets, green transition pressures.


## Technology & Trends

* **Digital platforms** and algo-trading increasing speed and efficiency.
* **Data-driven analytics**: Weather models, satellite imagery, AI for crop forecasts.
* **Sustainability**: Growth of carbon credits, green energy certificates.
* **Tokenization**: Commodities-backed digital assets emerging.


## Financial vs Physical perspectives

Commodities trading is about navigating **global supply-demand dynamics, geopolitics, and risk management**, using a mix of **physical trade, futures markets, and financial instruments**. It’s where **real-world goods meet financial markets**.

### Financial markets (Paper Trading)

This is the **financialized side** of commodities:

* **Futures & Derivatives**: Traders buy and sell standardized contracts on exchanges (CME, ICE, LME) without ever touching the physical commodity. Example: speculating on oil prices going up without owning a barrel.
* **Hedging**: Airlines lock in future fuel costs, farmers secure prices for crops before harvest, miners protect against falling metal prices.
* **Speculation**: Hedge funds and retail traders try to profit from short-term price moves (like gold before inflation or natural gas in a cold winter).
* **Arbitrage**: Exploiting mispricings — between markets (US vs Europe), time periods (this month vs next month), or products (e.g., crude oil vs gasoline spread).
* **Indices & ETFs**: Investors gain exposure without managing futures directly.

Here, it’s mostly about **price charts, volatility, leverage, and financial risk**.

### Physical logistics (Real Trading)

This is the **real-world movement of goods**:

* **Producers**: Oil rigs, mines, farms.
* **Transport & storage**: Tankers, rail, warehouses, pipelines.
* **Trading houses**: Glencore, Trafigura, Cargill buy from producers, manage logistics, and sell to consumers (industrials, governments, utilities).
* **Consumers**: Refineries, power plants, food companies, manufacturers.
* **Supply chain risks**: Port congestion, sanctions, strikes, weather disruptions, quality mismatches.

Here, the business is about **supply-demand flows, arbitrage between regions, and managing logistics & credit risk**.

### Summary

* **Financial commodities trading** is like Wall Street (futures, options, speculation).
* **Physical commodities trading** is like Main Street + shipping lanes (oil on tankers, wheat in silos, metals in warehouses).

Both worlds are deeply connected — futures prices influence physical trade, and real-world disruptions shake the financial markets.


## Lifecycle of a Commodity Trade

Let’s walk through the **full lifecycle of a commodity trade**, step by step, showing how **physical flows** and **financial hedging** interact.

### Production (Supply Side)

* **Producers**: oil wells, mines, farms, plantations.
* They extract or harvest the raw commodity (e.g., crude oil, copper, coffee).
* Often **sell forward** to secure predictable revenues (hedging against price drops).

📌 Example: A copper miner locks in sales for the next 6 months using futures contracts on the LME.


### Sale to Trading House

* Producers rarely deal directly with all end buyers.
* **Trading houses** (Glencore, Vitol, Trafigura, Cargill, etc.) step in:

  * Buy from producers.
  * Handle transport, storage, blending, and delivery.
  * Often finance producers in exchange for offtake agreements (long-term supply deals).

📌 Example: Cargill buys soybeans from Brazilian farmers and arranges shipping to China.


### Logistics & Storage

* Commodities move through **supply chains**:

  * Oil → pipelines, tankers, refineries.
  * Wheat → silos, trains, ports.
  * Copper → warehouses, smelters, factories.
* Traders arbitrage geography (cheap wheat in Ukraine, expensive in Egypt).
* Storage allows them to play **time arbitrage** (carry trade: buy cheap now, store, sell later at higher futures prices).

📌 Example: Trafigura stores crude oil in tankers when futures are in contango (future > spot price).


### Financing & Risk Management

* Physical trade requires **massive capital** (billions).
* Banks and trade-finance desks provide credit lines, letters of credit (LCs), collateralized against cargo.
* **Hedging**: Traders use futures, swaps, and options to lock in margins:

  * Long physical (buy oil) → Short futures (sell oil contracts) to avoid price risk.
  * Keeps profits stable regardless of market swings.

📌 Example: A trader buys crude at $80/barrel, sells futures at $82 to lock in a $2 margin.


### Delivery & Transformation

* Commodities reach end users:

  * Crude oil → refineries → gasoline, jet fuel.
  * Wheat → flour mills → bread & pasta.
  * Copper → smelters → wiring & electronics.
* Sometimes trading houses also own downstream assets (refineries, smelters, mills) to capture extra margin.

📌 Example: An oil trader delivers crude to a refinery, which refines and sells gasoline to distributors.


### End Consumption (Demand Side)

* Final consumers drive demand:

  * Airlines (jet fuel).
  * Utilities (natural gas, coal).
  * Food companies (sugar, cocoa).
  * Tech & auto industries (metals).
* Demand fluctuations (recessions, weather, policy) feed back into price cycles.


### How Physical & Financial Worlds Tie Together

* **Physical trade** = moving molecules & bushels.
* **Financial trade** = managing risks & speculation.
* Traders are **“asset-light” risk managers**: their edge lies in logistics expertise **plus** smart hedging.

📌 Without hedging, a tanker of oil can swing **tens of millions in value overnight**. Futures make the business survivable.

✅ So, the lifecycle is: **Producer → Trader → Logistics → Financing/Hedging → Delivery → Consumer**.


### Financial Instruments mapping

Here’s a **matrix view** showing which players in the commodity trade lifecycle typically use each financial instrument. This lets you see at a glance how **producers, traders, banks, and consumers** interact with tools like forwards, LCs, futures, swaps, and options.

## Case studies

### ✈️ Airline Hedging Jet Fuel

**Problem**: An airline is exposed to **volatile jet fuel prices**. If oil spikes, their costs soar.
  
**Solution**

  * The airline **buys futures** on jet fuel (or crude oil as a proxy).
  * If oil prices rise, futures profits **offset higher fuel costs**.
  * If oil prices fall, they lose on futures but **save on actual fuel**.
  
**Instruments used**: **Futures, Swaps, Options**.
**Players involved**: Airline (consumer), bank (swap counterparty), exchange.

✅ Outcome: The airline locks in stable costs → fewer surprises in ticket pricing.


### 🌱 Cargill Financing Soybeans

**Problem**: Brazilian farmers harvest soybeans but need **cash upfront** to run operations. They can’t wait until shipment to China.
  
**Solution**

  * **Cargill provides financing** in exchange for an **offtake agreement** (future soybean delivery).
  * A **Letter of Credit** (LC) from a bank ensures payment security across borders.
  * Cargill **hedges on CBOT futures** to lock in margins between Brazil purchase price and China selling price.
  
**Instruments used**: **Forwards, LCs, Futures**.
**Players involved**: Farmer (producer), Cargill (trader), Bank (financing), Chinese buyer (consumer).

✅ Outcome: Farmer gets liquidity, Cargill secures supply, bank earns fees, and buyer gets reliable delivery.

### Summary

These two examples show how **financial tools (paper trading)** and **physical flows (ships, silos, planes)** are always intertwined.

Here’s a side-by-side comparison of the two case studies highlighting the actors, risks, instruments, and goals for each.

||Actors|Main Risk|Instruments Used|Goal|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Case Study 1: Airline Hedging Jet Fuel| Airline (Consumer), Bank, Exchange|Fuel price volatility (rising oil costs)|Futures, Swaps, Options|Stabilize jet fuel costs|
|Case Study 2: Cargill Soybean Financing|Farmer (Producer), Cargill (Trader), Bank, Chinese Buyer|Financing needs + price risk in international trade|Forward Sales, Letters of Credit, Futures|Secure financing, manage trade flows, lock in margins
