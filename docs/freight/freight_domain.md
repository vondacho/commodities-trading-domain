# Freight in Commodities Trading

Freight is a critical component in commodities trading, connecting the **physical movement of commodities** (oil, LNG, coal, grains, metals, etc.) with the **financial and contractual side** of trading.  

It directly affects delivered cost, arbitrage opportunities, and risk management.  

Freight must integrate with **Trading, Risk, Operations, and Finance** systems.
